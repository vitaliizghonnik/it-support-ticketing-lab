## VNC Setup: Windows 10 Pro (Client) to Windows 10 Enterprise (Server)
> [!NOTE]
> In this case, you need to install 3rd party software. I've chosen to install TightVNC.
Similar to the RDP protocol, a VNC connection allows the server machine to stay logged in.

### Steps of installing VNC Viewer on Client and Server

1. Download and launch the installation wizard for VNC Viewer software on both machines.
2. Configure the IP Addresses on the VNC server and the VNC client, as well as the ports (if necessary).
In my case, I left ports set up by default.
3. Run VNC Viewer on VNC Client and fill out the field with the name of the VNC Server, followed by a colon and the port number to connect to.
